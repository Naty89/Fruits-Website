# Fruits-Website

This website project was made using the django framework. It has a list of fruits and the origin of the fruits. Furthermore, there is a form that allows a person to add to the fruit list by uploading a picture of the fruit, the name, and the origin. Another feature that is on website is that a user is a ble to search for a fruit by its name or origin along with their pictures. Additionally, I used pagination in order to organize the list of fruits.
